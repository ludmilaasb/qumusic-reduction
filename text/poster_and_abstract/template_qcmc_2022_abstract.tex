With the emergence of quantum computers, the class of combinatorial optimization problems is one of the potential targets to tackle. In the context of current quantum devices subjected to the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) paradigm, one of the promising algorithms is Quantum Annealing (QA) which runs in the framework of Adiabatic Quantum Computing. QA is used for solving optimization tasks expressed in terms of an Ising Hamiltonian designed in such a way that its ground state encapsulates the optimal solution to the considered problem. Obtaining the Ising Hamiltonian is not always a trivial task and it is often more convenient to express problems in the form of  Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), which can then be expressed in the form of an Ising Hamiltonian.

Among the optimization problems, the class of scheduling problems has significance both for the areas of computer science and operations research. Operational Fixed Interval Scheduling Problem (OFISP)  is characterized as the problem of assigning a number of jobs, each with a fixed starting and end time and a weight, to a number of machines with the restrictions that each machine can handle a single job at a time and preemption is not allowed. The objective is to find an assignment of jobs to the machines with maximal total weight. Now, we introduce another constraint known as no idle-time in the literature so that while the total weight is maximized, the duration that the machines are idle is minimized simultaneously and we obtain a multiobjective problem. We call this version of the problem as Operational Fixed Interval Scheduling Problem with No-Idle Time (OFISP$_\text{n-i}$).   

One possible application to the OFISP$_\text{n-i}$ is the music reduction problem, a process that reduces the number of tracks in a multi-instrument music piece so that the resulting music consists of less number of tracks and preserves the characteristics of the original piece as much as possible. In the scope of the music reduction problem, each track is separated into phrases, which are equivalent to jobs in the OFISP$_\text{n-i}$ scenario. Each phrase has an associated weight determined by its information entropy. The goal is to select the phrases in such a way that the ones containing the most information about the original music piece are selected and the silence between the selected phrases is minimized. The number of new tracks for the reduced music piece is equivalent to the machines performing the jobs.  

In this paper, we present a QUBO formulation for the OFISP$_\text{n-i}$ in general and provide experimental results for the case of music reduction. The problem is expressed using a QUBO formulation by introducing binary variables to represent which job is selected for a time point and the objective is to maximize the total weight of the selected jobs. Additional terms are introduced to make sure that the number of selected jobs at a time is equal to the number of machines and that the idle-time is minimized. The experimental results are obtained using the commercially available D-Wave Solvers.

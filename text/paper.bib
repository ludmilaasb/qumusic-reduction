	abstract = {We analyze a scheduling problem in which each job has a fixed start and end time and a value. We describe an algorithm which maximizes the value of jobs completed by k identical machines. The algorithm runs in time O(n2 log n), where n is the number of jobs. We also show that the problem is NP-complete under the following restriction: Associated with each job is a subset of the machines on which it can be processed. For a fixed number of machines k, an O(nk+1) time algorithm is presented.}

	abstract="Music can be regarded as sequences of localized patterns, such as chords, rhythmic patterns, and melodic patterns. In the study of music generation, how to generate sequences that are musically adequate is an important issue. In particular, generating sequences by controlling the relationships between local patterns and global structures is a difficult and open problem. Whereas grammatical approaches, which examine global structures, can be used to analyze how a piece is constructed, they are not necessarily designed to generate new pieces by controlling the characteristics of global structures, such as the redundancy of a sequence or the statistical distribution of specific patterns. To achieve this, we must overcome the difficulty of solving computationally complex problems. To deal with this problem, we take an integer-programming-based approach and show that some important characteristics of global structures can be described only by linear equalities and inequalities, which are suitable for integer programming.",

	abstract = {The Operational Fixed Interval Scheduling Problem (OFISP) is characterized as the problem of scheduling a number of jobs, each with a fixed starting time, a fixed finishing time, a priority index, and a job class. The objective is to find an assignment of jobs to machines with maximal total priority. The problem is complicated by the restrictions that: (i) each machine can handle only one job at a time, (ii) each machine can handle only jobs from a prespecified subset of all possible job classes, and (iii) preemption is not allowed. It follows from the above that OFISP has both the character of a job scheduling problem and the character of an assignment problem. In this paper we discuss the occurrence of the problem in practice, and we present newly developed exact and approximation algorithms for solving OFISP. Finally, some computational results are shown.}

A PTSP is concerned with assigning a set of tasks with fixed start and end time to a heterogeneous workforce. Each person in the workforce works a shift with given start and end times as well as having skills that qualify the person to perform a subset of all the tasks. This type of problem arises in rostering applications. There are several variations depending on the objective and the exact nature of the constraints. The aim of this paper is to describe this class of problems together with some basic properties, to survey previous work in this area, and to introduce some data sets that may serve as a test bed for future developments in this area.",

	abstract = {The defining characteristic of fixed interval scheduling problems is that each job has a finite number of fixed processing intervals. A job can be processed only in one of its intervals on one of the available machines, or is not processed at all. A decision has to be made about a subset of the jobs to be processed and their assignment to the processing intervals such that the intervals on the same machine do not intersect. These problems arise naturally in different real-life operations planning situations, including the assignment of transports to loading/unloading terminals, work planning for personnel, computer wiring, bandwidth allocation of communication channels, printed circuit board manufacturing, gene identification and examining computer memory structures. We present a general formulation of the interval scheduling problem, show its relations to cognate problems in graph theory, and survey existing models, results on computational complexity and solution algorithms.}

	abstract = {Abstract In interval scheduling, not only the processing times of the jobs but also their starting times are given. This article surveys the area of interval scheduling and presents proofs of results that have been known within the community for some time. We first review the complexity and approximability of different variants of interval scheduling problems. Next, we motivate the relevance of interval scheduling problems by providing an overview of applications that have appeared in literature. Finally, we focus on algorithmic results for two important variants of interval scheduling problems. In one variant we deal with nonidentical machines: instead of each machine being continuously available, there is a given interval for each machine in which it is available. In another variant, the machines are continuously available but they are ordered, and each job has a given “maximal” machine on which it can be processed. We investigate the complexity of these problems and describe algorithms for their solution. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics, 2007},

	abstract = {Score reduction is a process that arranges music for a target instrument by reducing original music. In this study we present a music arrangement framework that uses score reduction to automatically arrange music for a target instrument. The original music is first analyzed to determine the type of arrangement element of each section, then the phrases are identified and each is assigned a utility according to its type of arrangement element. For a set of utility-assigned phrases, we transform the music arrangement into an optimization problem and propose a phrase selection algorithm. The music is arranged by selecting appropriate phrases satisfying the playability constraints of a target instrument. Using the proposed framework, we implement a music arrangement system for the piano. An approach similar to Turing test is used to evaluate the quality of the music arranged by our system. The experiment results show that our system is able to create viable music for the piano.},

All trips must be performed. The total time of operations on any vehicle is limited. We develop a mixed integer model to find the optimal number of vehicles at a minimum cost. Based on the hard nature of the problem, we propose six heuristics. Computational results reveal that heuristics return exceptionally good solutions for problem instances with up to 100 jobs in very small computation times, and are likely to perform well for larger instances.}

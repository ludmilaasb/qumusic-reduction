	abstract="Music can be regarded as sequences of localized patterns, such as chords, rhythmic patterns, and melodic patterns. In the study of music generation, how to generate sequences that are musically adequate is an important issue. In particular, generating sequences by controlling the relationships between local patterns and global structures is a difficult and open problem. Whereas grammatical approaches, which examine global structures, can be used to analyze how a piece is constructed, they are not necessarily designed to generate new pieces by controlling the characteristics of global structures, such as the redundancy of a sequence or the statistical distribution of specific patterns. To achieve this, we must overcome the difficulty of solving computationally complex problems. To deal with this problem, we take an integer-programming-based approach and show that some important characteristics of global structures can be described only by linear equalities and inequalities, which are suitable for integer programming.",

	abstract = {The Operational Fixed Interval Scheduling Problem (OFISP) is characterized as the problem of scheduling a number of jobs, each with a fixed starting time, a fixed finishing time, a priority index, and a job class. The objective is to find an assignment of jobs to machines with maximal total priority. The problem is complicated by the restrictions that: (i) each machine can handle only one job at a time, (ii) each machine can handle only jobs from a prespecified subset of all possible job classes, and (iii) preemption is not allowed. It follows from the above that OFISP has both the character of a job scheduling problem and the character of an assignment problem. In this paper we discuss the occurrence of the problem in practice, and we present newly developed exact and approximation algorithms for solving OFISP. Finally, some computational results are shown.}

	abstract="In this paper we introduce a group of problems called Personnel Task Scheduling Problems (PTSP). A PTSP is concerned with assigning a set of tasks with fixed start and end time to a heterogeneous workforce. Each person in the workforce works a shift with given start and end times as well as having skills that qualify the person to perform a subset of all the tasks. This type of problem arises in rostering applications. There are several variations depending on the objective and the exact nature of the constraints. The aim of this paper is to describe this class of problems together with some basic properties, to survey previous work in this area, and to introduce some data sets that may serve as a test bed for future developments in this area.",

	abstract = {The defining characteristic of fixed interval scheduling problems is that each job has a finite number of fixed processing intervals. A job can be processed only in one of its intervals on one of the available machines, or is not processed at all. A decision has to be made about a subset of the jobs to be processed and their assignment to the processing intervals such that the intervals on the same machine do not intersect. These problems arise naturally in different real-life operations planning situations, including the assignment of transports to loading/unloading terminals, work planning for personnel, computer wiring, bandwidth allocation of communication channels, printed circuit board manufacturing, gene identification and examining computer memory structures. We present a general formulation of the interval scheduling problem, show its relations to cognate problems in graph theory, and survey existing models, results on computational complexity and solution algorithms.}
